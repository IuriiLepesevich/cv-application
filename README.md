# CV Application

This project was build during TheOdinProject curriculum. This is the first project in which React framework was used. Idea of this project is to work with React compinents. Using form in live demo, you can input data in input fields, add/remove form sections and wsubmit the form. With submitting, input fields will be rerendered to the text format. After submission - you can edit the form again.
